Transmission Control Protocol, outgoing traffic

The output functions of TCP.

There are two distinct ways for TCP segments to get sent\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item queued data\+: these are segments transferring data or segments containing SYN or FIN (which both count as one sequence number). They are created as struct \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pbuf}{Packet buffers (PBUF)}} together with a struct tcp\+\_\+seg and enqueue to the unsent list of the pcb. They are sent by tcp\+\_\+output\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item tcp\+\_\+write \+: creates data segments
\item tcp\+\_\+split\+\_\+unsent\+\_\+seg \+: splits a data segment
\item tcp\+\_\+enqueue\+\_\+flags \+: creates SYN-\/only or FIN-\/only segments
\item tcp\+\_\+output / tcp\+\_\+output\+\_\+segment \+: finalize the tcp header (e.\+g. sequence numbers, options, checksum) and output to IP
\item the various tcp\+\_\+rexmit functions shuffle around segments between the unsent an unacked lists to retransmit them
\item tcp\+\_\+create\+\_\+segment and tcp\+\_\+pbuf\+\_\+prealloc allocate pbuf and segment for these functions
\end{DoxyItemize}
\item direct send\+: these segments don\textquotesingle{}t contain data but control the connection behaviour. They are created as pbuf only and sent directly without enqueueing them\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item tcp\+\_\+send\+\_\+empty\+\_\+ack sends an ACK-\/only segment
\item tcp\+\_\+rst sends a RST segment
\item tcp\+\_\+keepalive sends a keepalive segment
\item tcp\+\_\+zero\+\_\+window\+\_\+probe sends a window probe segment
\item tcp\+\_\+output\+\_\+alloc\+\_\+header allocates a header-\/only pbuf for these functions 
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}
