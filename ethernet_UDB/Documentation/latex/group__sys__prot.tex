Used to protect short regions of code against concurrent access.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Your system is a bare-\/metal system (probably with an RTOS) and interrupts are under your control\+: Implement this as Lock\+Interrupts() / Unlock\+Interrupts()
\item Your system uses an RTOS with deferred interrupt handling from a worker thread\+: Implement as a global mutex or lock/unlock scheduler
\item Your system uses a high-\/level OS with e.\+g. POSIX signals\+: Implement as a global mutex
