Network buffer descriptor for \mbox{\hyperlink{group__netconn}{Netconn API}}. Based on \mbox{\hyperlink{group__pbuf}{Packet buffers (PBUF)}} internally to avoid copying data around.~\newline
Buffers must not be shared accross multiple threads, all functions except netbuf\+\_\+new() and netbuf\+\_\+delete() are not thread-\/safe.
