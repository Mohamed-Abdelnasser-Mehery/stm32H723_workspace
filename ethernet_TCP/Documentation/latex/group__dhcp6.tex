DHCPv6 client\+: IPv6 address autoconfiguration as per RFC 3315 (stateful DHCPv6) and RFC 3736 (stateless DHCPv6).

For now, only stateless DHCPv6 is implemented!

TODO\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item enable/disable API to not always start when RA is received
\item stateful DHCPv6 (for now, only stateless DHCPv6 for DNS and NTP servers works)
\item create Client Identifier?
\item only start requests if a valid local address is available on the netif
\item only start information requests if required (not for every RA)
\end{DoxyItemize}

dhcp6\+\_\+enable\+\_\+stateful() enables stateful DHCPv6 for a netif (stateless disabled)~\newline
dhcp6\+\_\+enable\+\_\+stateless() enables stateless DHCPv6 for a netif (stateful disabled)~\newline
dhcp6\+\_\+disable() disable DHCPv6 for a netif

When enabled, requests are only issued after receipt of RA with the corresponding bits set.
